## I. Javascript algorithm
### 1. 
  - My idea here is:
    + Firstly, initialize an empty Object called 'obj'
    + Secondly, map the array if the item doesn't exist yet, initialize the key whose value is that item. Else if the item already exist, just increase by one
    + Lastly, just get max of value of the 'obj' which is the string length appear most in array and then return the string whose length is equal with the max value
### 2. 
  - I think that: 'Sum of integers on top 2' is which one is greater than 2 then the result will plus by that one otherwise the result will minus by that one
## II. React
  I use Axios-hooks to RestfullAPI and then use boostrap to build the table looking more prettier
